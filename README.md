# ROS PACKER

This little python project is actually just the inversion of [ros_pack](https://github.com/iam-TJ/ros_pack "Iam-TJ's ros_pack") written by Iam-TJ. Unfortunately, his project is not beeing maintained anymore.
The state of the given reverse engineering has not beeing touched, but **ros_packer** supports mirroring for copying unknown Bytes.


## What is ROS?

`*.ros`-files are commonly used as Firmware-format on routers, switches etc. They are also used as firmware upgrade media and usually carry the whole software on such devices. The structure of a `*.ros`-file consists of serveral payloads, that come with headers and subheaders.
