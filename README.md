# ROS PACKER

This little python project is actually just the inversion of [ros_pack](https://github.com/iam-TJ/ros_pack "Iam-TJ's awesome ros_pack") written by Iam-TJ. Unfortunately, his project is not beeing maintained anymore, but that was my motivation to implement the packing routine.
The state of the given reverse engineering has not beeing touched, but **ros_packer** supports mirroring for copying unknown Bytes.

This is the place where my programming project, **-the lovely ros_packer-** will grow up. Fingers crosed!

## What the ROS!?

`*.ros`-files are commonly used as Firmware-format on routers, switches etc. They are also used as firmware upgrade media and they usual carry the whole software on such devices. Since the container reversing of the ros-format is not completly done or public (well, as far as I know), **ros_packer** tries its best overcomeing lacks.
